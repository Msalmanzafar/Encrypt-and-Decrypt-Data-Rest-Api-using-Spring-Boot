In this tutorial, we will see how to use AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to string or text in Java with an example.

Java support many secure encryption algorithms but some of them are weak to be used in security-intensive applications. For example, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm is considered highly insecure; messages encrypted using DES have been decrypted by brute force within a single day by machines such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) Deep Crack.


A more secure encryption algorithm is AES – Advanced Encryption Standard which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. AES encryption is used by the U.S. for securing sensitive but unclassified material, so we can say it is enough to secure.
